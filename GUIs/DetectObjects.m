function varargout = DetectObjects(varargin)
%DETECTOBJECTS M-file for DetectObjects.fig
%      DETECTOBJECTS, by itself, creates a new DETECTOBJECTS or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = DETECTOBJECTS returns the handle to a new DETECTOBJECTS or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      DETECTOBJECTS('Property','Value',...) creates a new DETECTOBJECTS using the
%      given property value pairs. Unrecognized properties are passed via
%      varargin to DetectObjects_OpeningFcn.  This calling syntax produces a
%      warning when there is an existing singleton*.
%
%      DETECTOBJECTS('CALLBACK') and DETECTOBJECTS('CALLBACK',hObject,...) call the
%      local function named CALLBACK in DETECTOBJECTS.M with the given input
%      arguments.
